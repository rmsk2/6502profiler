; --------------------------------------------------
; mul16BitFast mutiplies the bytes contained in accu and x register 
; The high byte of the result is returned in accu, the lo byte in the x register.
; The three macro parameters specify temporary memory to use by the calculation.
;
; The basis for the speedup is the formula xy = (x^2 + y^ 2 - (x-y)^2)/2
; where the squares are read from the lookup tables above. This routine seems to be
; twice as fast as the simple multiplication routine mul16BitShiftAdd which uses shift and add
