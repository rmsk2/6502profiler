# `6502profiler`

## Overview

This software is in essence an emulator for the MOS 6502, 6510 and the 65C02 microprocessors. In contrast to the plethora of 
emulators that already exist for these microprocessors it does not aim to emulate an existing retro computer with all its features like graphics 
and sound. It is rather intended to be a development tool for optimizing and verifying the implementation of pure algorithms on old or new
machines which use these classic microprocessors. To state this again: No graphics or sound capabilities of any kind are emulated and therefore 
routines like that can not be optimized by using `6502profiler`.

`6502profiler` reads a binary as for instance created by the `ACME` macro assembler and executes it inside the emulator. While running the program
the number of clock cycles that are used up during execution are counted. Additionally `6502profiler` can be used to identify "hot spots" in the 
program because also it keeps track of how many times each memory cell is accessed (i.e. read and/or written). 

On top of that `6502profiler` offers the possibility to implement tests for assembly subroutines where arranging the test data and evaluating the
results is offloaded to a Lua script.

**Caution: This is work in pogress, things will change and maybe even break.**

## Emulator configuration

The config is stored in a JSON file and can be used through the `-c` option. The config file is structured as follows

```
{
    "Model": 1,
    "MemSpec": "Linear64K",
    "IoMask": 45,
    "IoAddrConfig": {
        "221": "file:output.bin"   
    },
    "PreLoad": {
        "40960": "/home/martin/data/vice_roms/C64/basic",
        "57344": "/home/martin/data/vice_roms/C64/kernal"
    },    
    "AcmeBinary": "acme",
    "AcmeSrcDir": "./testprg",
    "AcmeBinDir": "./testprg/tests/bin",
    "AcmeTestDir": "./testprg/tests"
}
```

`Model` can be 0 or 1. The number 0 encodes a standard 6502/6510 and 1 stands for a 65C02. At the moment `MemSpec` can be 
`Linear16K`, `Linear32K`, `Linear64K`, `XSixteen512K` or `XSixteen2048K`. The linear memory specifications denote a contiguous
chunk of memory starting at address 0 with a length of 16, 32 or 64 kilobytes. The `XSixteen` memory specifications
configure the emulator to use the memory model of the Commander X16 with either 512K oder 2048K of banked RAM. 

`IoMask` and `IoAddrConfig` can be used to configure special I/O adresses that allow to exfiltrate data 
from the emulator by means of writing to a special I/O address. 

The value in `IoMask` spcifies the hi byte of all such special addresses and each entry in `IoAddrConfig` specifies the 
corresponding lo byte of one special address as well as a name of a file to which bytes are written each time data is stored 
in that address via `sta`, `stx`, `sty` or instructions that modify data in place as for instance `inc`. In the example above 
the resulting special address is `$2ddd` ($2d=45, $dd=221). Entries for such file store addresses start with `file:` and the 
remaining string specifies the file name. If no such special addresses are needed then `IoAddrConfig` should be empty.

If you want to load binaries into the emulator's RAM before your program is run you can list these binaries in the `PreLoad`
property. Each entry is a key value pair where the key is the address to which the binary should be loaded and the value is
the name of the file which contains the binary to load. This can for instance be used to load ROM images. It has to be noted
though that these images are of limited use because `6502profiler` does not emulate any I/O, timing or interrupt behaviour.

The `AcmeBinary`entry defines the path to the `acme` program binary. `AcmeSrcDir` has to describe the path to the directory where 
the assembler source files (which do not implement the tests themselves) are stored. `AcmeTestDir` holds the directory where
the test case files, the assembler source for the test drivers and the test scripts are located. Assembled test drivers are 
stored in the directory referenced by `AcmeBinDir`.

# How to use `6502profiler`

`6502profiler` has a command line interface. The first parameter is a so called command. Currently the following
commands are implemented.

```
The following commands are available: 
     info: Return info about program
     newcase: Create a new test case skeleton
     profile: Record data about program executions
     verify: Run a test on an assembler program
     verifyall: Run all tests
```

## The `profile` command

This command is intended to collect and evaluate data about the performance of the program under test. It understands the following 
command line options:

```
./6502profiler profile -h
Usage of 6502profiler profile:
  -c string
    	Config file name
  -label string
    	Path to the label file generated by the ACME assembler
  -out string
    	Path to the out file that holds the generated data
  -prcnt uint
    	Percentage used to determine cut off value (default 10)
  -prg string
    	Path to the program to run
  -strategy string
    	Strategy to determine cutoff value (default "median")
```

The most important option is the `-prg` option which can be used to specify the binary to run. It is expected that the first two bytes
of the binary contain the load address in the usual form (lo byte first). It is also expected that execution of the program will start at
this address. The final instruction in a program that is run by `6502profiler` has to be `BRK` and not `RTS` as `BRK` halts the emulator.

If the `-out` option is specified `6502profiler` outputs statistical data about the current program execution. The output contains two
types of lines. Label lines and address lines. The following example illustrates a label line followed by three address lines.

```
SQ_TAB_LSB
     0803: 00 50350
     0804: 01 1056087
###  0805: 8A 5591244
``` 

Label lines are created through the data contained in the symbol list file generated by the `ACME` macro assember when it is called with the 
`-l` option. The path to this file has to be provided through the `-label` option of `6502profiler`. Label lines serve as a basic
link between the output of `6502profiler` and the source code of the program that is evaluated. An address line contains an address 
followed by a colon. This address is followed by the byte stored at this memory location at the end of the execution of the program. This in 
turn is follwed by the number of times the address has been accessed (read and written) by the running program. When an address line 
starts with `###` the corresponding address has been accessed "more often" than is usual during program execution. 

The condition what "more often" actually is, is determined by the options `-strategy` and `-prcnt`. `-prcnt` has to be a number between
0 and 100. The value 25 for instance means that all addresses in the output are flagged which are in the top 25% percent of all access
numbers. The `-strategy` option determines what constitiutes the overall set of numbers. `median` sorts all access values and uses
the lowest value in the top `n%` (n being the value of the `-prcnt` option) as a threshold. Any other value for the `-strategy` option
sorts the access values after removing all duplicate values. In first experiments no significant differences between the two strategies
have been found. If `-out` is used, then `-label` also has to be specified. `-prcnt` and `-strategy` are optional. The default values 
are 10 and `median`.

The report file created by `ACME` when specifying its `-r` option can be used to more precisely link the output of `6502profiler`
to the assembly source code. This may serve as an example:

```
     5  0800 a922               lda #34
     6  0802 a22d               ldx #45
     7  0804 20080a             jsr mul16BitFast
     8  0807 00                 brk
     9                          
    10                          ; xy = (x^2 + y^2 - (x-y)^2)/2
    11                          ; The following tables contain the LSB and MSB of i^2 where i=0, ..., 255
    12                          SQ_TAB_LSB
    13  0808 0001040910192431...!byte $00, $01, $04, $09, $10, $19, $24, $31, $40, $51, $64, $79, $90, $A9, $C4, $E1
```

The first number is the line number in the source file. The second number is the address to which the machine language
instruction has been written in the output.

## The `verify` and `verifyall` commands

These commands are intended to facilitate the testing of assembly subroutines. You can see `6502profiler`
in action for this purpose in my 6502 arithmetic library [project](https://github.com/rmsk2/6502-Arithmetic).
The `verify` command can be used to run one specific test case and its command line syntax is as follows:

```
./6502profiler verify -h
Usage of 6502profiler verify:
  -c string
    	Config file name
  -t string
    	Test case file
```

The name of the test case file is interpreted relative to the directory specified by the `AcmeTestDir` configuration entry. The `.json` 
suffix of the filename can be omitted. In order to run all test cases in that directory see the `verifyall` command as described below.

The general idea is to have a source file which contains the subroutine to test in one directory (the source directory as given in 
`AcmeSrcDir`) and an additional separate test driver program in a test directory (named by `AcmeTestDir`) which calls the routines
that are to be tested in an appropriate fashion. The test driver includes the files which contain the subroutines to test (using 
the `!source` pseudo opcode) from the source directory. Then the test driver is assembled (or compiled) into the test binary directory.
This directory is specified by `AcmeBinDir`.

The `verify` command then loads the test driver binary and a corresponding Lua test script. This script has to define at least
two functions `arrange` and `assert`. Before running the test driver in the emulator the `verify` command calls the `arrange`
function in the Lua script which can modify the emulator state before the test driver is run (for instance to arrange test data). 
Then the test driver is run by the emulator and when that is done the `assert`function of the test script evaluates whether
the program returned the expected result. The test is successfull if the `assert` script returns `true`.

The source files for the test driver and the test script have to be referenced in a JSON test case file which has the following
format:

```
{
    "Name": "Simple loop test",
    "TestDriverSource": "test1.a",
    "TestScript": "test1.lua"
}

```

The file names are interpreted relative to the directory specified by the `AcmeTestDir` configuration entry. Here an example for a test 
driver and a test script. Let's say we want to test the subroutine `simpleLoop` defined in `test_loop.a` in the source directory:

```
.DATA_IN
!byte 0x40,0x30,0x20,0x10
.DATA_OUT
!byte 0,0,0,0

simpleLoop
    ldy #3
    lda #<.DATA_IN
    sta $12
    lda #>.DATA_IN
    sta $13
.loop
    lda ($12), y
    sta .DATA_OUT,y
    dey
    bpl .loop
    rts
```

We then write the test driver and store it as `test1.a` in the test directory.

```
* = $0800

jmp testStart

!source "test_loop.a"

testStart
    jsr simpleLoop
    brk
```

It is assumed that the test driver starts its execution at the load address which has to be contained in the first two bytes of the
binary (as usual lo byte first). The emulator stops when it encounters a `BRK` instruction. Finally the corresponding test script is 
implemented and also stored (as `test1.lua` ) in the test directory.

```
test_vector = "10203040"

function arrange()
    set_memory(load_address+3, test_vector)
end

function assert()
    d = get_memory(load_address+7, 4)
    fl = get_flags()
    data_ok = (d == test_vector)
    negative_is_set = (string.find(fl, "N", 0, true) ~= nil)
    error_msg = " \n"

    res = data_ok and negative_is_set

    if not data_ok then
        error_msg = error_msg .. string.format("data wrong '%s'\n", d)
    end

    if not negative_is_set then
        error_msg = error_msg .. string.format("negative flag not set: %s\n", fl)
    end

    return res, error_msg
end
```

`arrange` is expected to take no arguments and return no value. `assert` also takes no arguments but has to return two values. The first
one is a boolean and is set to true if the test was successfull. The second return value is a string and should contain some helpful
message in case the test has failed.

The `set_memory` and `get_memory` functions can be used to get and set emulator memory. Memory contents is always represented as a
hex string. On top of that the load address and the length of the test driver can be referenced in Lua by the variables `load_address`
and `prog_len`. A specific test can be run by `./6502profiler verify -c config.json -t test1.json`. The following functions can be used in 
Lua to query and manipulate the processor state:

|Function Name| Description |
|-|-|
| `set_memory(address, hex_data)` | Store the data given in `hex_data` at address `address`| 
| `get_memory(address, length)` | Return `length` bytes from the emulator beginning with the byte at address `address` as a hex string| 
| `read_byte(address)`| Returns a single byte from memory at the given address|
| `write_byte(address, value)`| Writes a single byte to memory at the given address|
| `get_flags()` | Returns an eight character string that contains the letters `NVBDIZC-`. A letter is in the string if the corresponding flag is set|
| `set_flags(flag_data)` | Sets the value of the flag register. If `flag_data` contains any of the letters described above the corresponding flag is set. Using `""` clears all flags |
| `get_pc()` | Returns the program counter |
| `get_sp()`| Returns the stack pointer |
| `get_accu()` | Returns the value stored in the accumulator | 
| `set_accu(val)` | Stores `val` in the accu | 
| `get_xreg()` | Returns the value stored in the X register | 
| `set_xreg(val)` | Stores `val` in the X register | 
| `get_yreg()` | Returns the value stored in the Y register | 
| `set_yreg(val)` | Stores `val` in the Y register | 

On top of that the following three variables are injected into the Lua script from the Go host program:

|Variable Name| Description |
|-|-|
| `load_address` | Address to which the test driver has been laoded and from which it is run | 
| `prog_len` | Length in bytes of the loaded test driver | 
| `test_dir` | Path to the test dir which can be used with `require` to load additional scripts | 


Assigning a value to these variables remains local to the Lua test script and does not influence what is happening in the golang
host application.

The `verifyall` command can be used to execute all test cases that are found in the `AcmeTestDir` as defined in the referenced
config file. It has the following syntax:

```
Usage of 6502profiler verifyall:
  -c string
    	Config file name
```

# The `newcase` command

This command can be used to create a JSON test case file, a Lua script and a test driver file in the test directory. It
uses the following command line options.  

```
Usage of 6502profiler newcase:
  -c string
    	Config file name
  -n string
    	Test name
  -p string
    	File name prefix
  -t string
    	Full name of test driver file in test dir (optional)
```

The prefix is used to generate the file names of all three files by appending the corresponding file endings `.json`, `.a` and
`.lua`. If `-t` is specified the test driver name in the newly created test case is set to the value of `-t`. This value has
to include the file ending (typically `.a`) and is interpreted as a file name relative to `AcmeTestDir`.

# Performance

I have used `6502profiler` to further optimize the calculation routines for my [C64](https://github.com/rmsk2/c64_mandelbrot) 
and [Commander X16](https://github.com/rmsk2/X16_mandelbrot) Mandelbrot set viewers. A C64 needs about 75 minutes to create 
the default visualization in hires mode using a program of 1827 bytes length. `6502profiler` executes this program in about
a minute. The corresponding assembler source code can be found in `testprg/fixed_test.a` and `testprg/fixed_point.a`

# Limitations

Currently all 6502/6510 addressing modes and all but one instruction are emulated. The missing instruction is `RTI` as I do not
see any use for this instruction on the purely logical level on which `6502profiler` operates. Furthermore the 65C02 instructions
`STP` and `WAI` are also not implemented for the same reason.

# Building `6502profiler`

The software is written in Go and therefore it can be built by the usual `go build` command. Tests are provided for all
6502 instructions and can be executed through `go test ./...`.

# Upcoming

- Maybe implement a single stepping mode
